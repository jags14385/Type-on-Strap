Since it is the start of 2019, I wanted to read more books in form actual books and ebooks.  The reason , for this endeavour , is to be introduced to new ideas , thought processes and understand the world view from a different author's perspective.

The hope here is the books would be a mix of Sci-fi + Fiction, real world skills introduction and books which enable me to see patterns in everyday life around.
Because, better observation leads to better understanding how the world around us works.

- The Time Machine by H.G. Wells is the first book I have picked this year.
