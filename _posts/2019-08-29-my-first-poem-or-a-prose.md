Love, Hope & Vulnerability

Hidden are these feelings  
shrouded are my fears  
All I want, is not to hide  
All I want, is to be seen  

What am I to you,  
Am I a stranger  
Or am I someone  
What am I to you .  

What am I for you ?  
Am I love or hate  
Am I hope or despair  
Am I courage or dread    
What am I for you ?  

What am I to you,  
Am I the past or the present  
Or am I the shrouded future  
What am I to you ?  
What am I for you ?  

Hidden are these feelings  
shrouded are my fears  
All I want, is not to hide    
All I want, is to be seen

**Hence, something to ponder about :**  
We ask this question, every single waking moment of our lives in one way or other. Is it really a question though ?
Are we really oblivious to the answer or do we lack the
courage to face the answer head on or do we hope that our  
effort is going give the result we want ?

Are we asking, "What am I for you" 
or are we seeking the answer to "What can I become for you , if a chance is provided...". Are we seeking to affect the future or relive the past, only the person can say.

The tussle within us to accept the reality to the reality 
we perceive is hard. The reality we perceive is sometimes is the reality we badly want it to be true. It brings us,
hope and despair in waves and bouts.That said, the hope is always greater.Without hope , there is no struggle & without struggle there is no earnestness & with out earnestness , there is no love. The hope is only possible , when we are open to vulnerability.

This struggle & the way we repsond to this defines us, in many a ways.

Hence the title : ***Love , Hope & Vulnerability.***
