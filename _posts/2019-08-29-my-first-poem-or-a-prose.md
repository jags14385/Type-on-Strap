" What am I to you .... "  
" Am I a stranger "  
" Or am I someone "  
" What am I to you .... "  


" What am I for you ???? "  
" Am I love or hate "  
" Am I hope or despair "  
" Am I courage or dread "  

" What am I for you ???? "  
" What am I to you .... "  
" Am I the past or the present "  
" Or am I the shrouded future "  
" What am I to you .... "  
" What am I for you .... "  


Hence, something to ponder about :  
We ask this question, every single waking moment of our lives in one way or other. Is it really a question though ?
Are we really oblivious to the answer or do we lack the
courage to face the answer head on or do we hope that our  
effort is going give the result we want ?

Are we asking, "What am I for you" 
or are we seeking the answer to "What can
I become for you , if belief is shown or not shown". 
Are we searching this the past or the future or in the present.

The tussle within us to accept the reality to the reality 
we perceive is hard.The reality we perceive is sometimes is the reality we badly want it to be true. It brings us,
hope and despair in waves and bouts.

This struggle & the way we repsond to this defines us, in many a ways.
