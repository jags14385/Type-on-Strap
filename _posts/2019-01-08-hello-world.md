The customary hello world blog post. 

It took me a while to zero in on the blog platform / ecosystem I wanted to use.

Things that I took into account while making this decision was :

* Ease of creating posts
* Hosting experience needs to be seamless & lean for me
* No excess use of JS & CSS unless it is really required

I experimented with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) , [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) , [GatsBy](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) & [Origami](http://www.origami.so/) for a blogging platform.

And looked at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) , [GCP](https://cloud.google.com)  , [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) & [Github](https://github.com) for hosting.

At the end of it , I decided to go with **Jekyll + Github** because : 
 - It costed me zero dollars to host & deploy.
 - I could focus on just creating posts 
 - Was easy enough

 Yes , a case could have been made for all the other platforms given enough time . I was not just not ready to put in the time & effort,
 when there was an easier solution in front of me, with no game-changing advantage that I would have missed.

 So that's all for now .... Ciao !!
