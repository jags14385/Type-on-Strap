Let's talk about __PAY__ , because no one talks about it enough in an empirical way.

It has taken me close to some 8+ years to understand and visualise how much I want to get paid or what exactly I am looking for in terms of pay. 

The interpretation of what __PAY__ means has evolved over time , for me.

Sources such as : 
- [ https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
- [ https://georgestocker.com/2019/03/14/my-salary-progression-in-tech/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
- __Reddit__ & the __Internet__ in general

have helped me navigate this labyrith.

Most of the articles I have read, have been predominantly of US based companies. This helped me understand expectations and also confused me , because the pay structures and offerings in US are differentcompared to other countries such as India & Australia, among others.

Additionally, I used some sort of average statistics to decide if I am the norm or the outlier in a given trend / behavior pattern observed in the industry.

Sources used for these calculations are :
- StackOverFlow Developer Survey
- Salary Distribution (incld perks + work life balance), among peers across different tech companies in the same discipline
- Inputs from Recruiters around what jobs are out there and pay structures + perks for those aforesaid jobs.

Assumptions taken while making these analysis :
- __PAY__ = __MONETARY SUM__ + __PERKS__ + __WORK LIFE BALANCE__ .
- One cannot just have a amazing carrer progression over a period of time , without being paid well. I have seen enough examples of it. You are free to disagree with this.
- You must not be a asshole/sexist/racist or any word which is similar or a synonym.
- Not all opportunities are equal.

__P.S.__ : Work life balance has a diverse interpretation and hence canot just be included as a __JOB PERK__.

Let's now just talk about the __Skills__ because this is the one of key factors which affects your __PAY__, others being :
- Work Ethic & Attitude
- EQ + IQ
- Interpersonal + IntraPersonal Skills & Intelligence

If Potential Future Pay (let's say __PFP__ for ease) can be represented as function,it could be described loosely by the below equation :

__PFP__ current = Pay for Skills you bring to the table * relevance_factor of those skills * expertise_factor ; 
__Relevance_factor of those skills__ can also be termed as __Perceived value of those skills__
__Bargaining Power__ = expertise_factor(skills) * Relevance_factor(skills) * demand_factor of those skills
__PFP__ future = __PFP__ current * __Bargaining Power__ + __Perks at Job__ + __Work Life Balance__

Things to consider while thinking your ```__PFP__ future``` :

- Depending on the opportunity and your skills , you can deviate " + or - of  7.5 % ".
- When you calculate or think about __Work Life Balance__ , one needs to put a monetary value against it , to ensure one is not getting pigeon holed or tunnel visioned. Think of it is a $$ value you want to travel that extra 30 mins everyday or whatever you feel is your work life baalnce factor. 
- Luck is a small factor , but not miniscule enough to be ignored.
- Skills that you bring to the table depends on the intial opportunities and quality of those opportunities.Self Learning helps a lot, in cases where you job doesn't provide you the kind of things you want to work on. It helps, if you identify yourself in such a situation and start doing the required remedial work, to ensure the quality stays.
- Having a mentor helps , but isn't always required. Enough great role models / mentors on the internet to help out.
- You define your parameters for performance and own it.
- Discussing your salary with people whom you really trust in the same sphere of work really helps, to know where you are.This is not always easy and you may get burnt sometimes. For me , it was a really eye opening experience, mostly positive.
- Market / Industry standards are more often than not misleading, and do not always help you in the negotiation. if you are getting paid below the "market/industry standards" you are severely underpaid, because I believe the standards in Software industry are skewed towards the lower end.

If you stay at a place where you are learning a lot and sacrificing pay , you need to timebox it. You cannot go like that for more than 12 to 15 months, because one never stops learning and your work will always keep improving.

Hope this helps :) . Cheers.
