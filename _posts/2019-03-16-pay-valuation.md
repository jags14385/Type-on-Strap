title: Pay Valuation ( DRAFT )

Something that I really care about in my carrer in addition to a lot of other things is "PAY" .

I have been working since Spetmber of 2010 onwards and it has taken me close to 8 and something years to visualise how much I want to get paid or what exactly I am looking for in terms of pay. 

The interpretation of what PAY means to me has evolved and also my understanding of it.

Articles such as : 
- https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
- https://georgestocker.com/2019/03/14/my-salary-progression-in-tech/
- Many more

have helped me , come to some decisions and insights .

Most of the articles I have read, have been predominantly of US Companies. This helped me understand expectations and also confused me , because the slary structures and offering in US is coherently different from India and Australia, among others.

In addition to this , I used some sort of average statistics to decide if I am the norm or the outlier in a given trend / behavior pattern observed in the industry.

- Not all oppurtunities are equal
- For the below to work , you must not be a asshole/sexist/racist or any word which is similar or a synonym.
- Your Potential Future Pay = ( function(skills you bring) * relevance_factor *         
                                      perceived_value * learning/adaptation_coefficient  expectations_from_life * Non monetary componenets of the Pay ) * risk_profile + Luck

      Luck is a small factor , but not small enough to be ignored.

  Skills that you bring to the table depends on the intial oppurtunities and quality of those. This means that if you start at FAANG or similar natured companies , you would be on a faster and a better trajectory comapred to others, statistically speaking.

  Self Learning helps a lot, in cases where you rjob doesn't provide you the kind of things you want to work on. It helps , if you identify yourself in such a situation and start dloing the required remedial work, to ensure the quality stays.

  Having a mentor helps , but isn't always required. Enough great role models on the internet to help out.

  You define your parameters and own it.


I believe I have digressed by a lot. Coming back to the point.  Currently I work as contractor, I ended yup making a google sheet to decide the corresponding 
daily pay rate to get a 120 % of an annual full time permamnent salary. this would give you the baseline.

Depending on the opurtunity and your skills , you can deviate " + or - of  7.5 % ".
Discussing your salalry with people whom you really trust in the same sphere of work 
really helps, to know where you are.

Market / Industry standards are more often than not misleading, and do not always help you in the negotiation. if you are getting paid below the "market/industry standards" you are severely underpaid, because I believe the standards in Software industry are skewed towards the lower end.
