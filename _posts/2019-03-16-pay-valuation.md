title: Pay Valuation ( DRAFT )

Something that I really care about in my carrer in addition to a lot of other things is "PAY" .

I have been working since Spetmber of 2010 onwards and it has taken me close to 8 and something years to visualise how much I want to get paid or what exactly I am looking for in terms of pay. 

The interpretation of what PAY means to me has evolved and also my understanding of it.

Articles such as : 
- https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
- https://georgestocker.com/2019/03/14/my-salary-progression-in-tech/
- Many more

have helped me , come to some decisions and insights .

Most of the articles I have read, have been predominantly of US Companies. This helped me understand expectations and also confused me , because the slary structures and offering in US is coherently different from India and Australia, among others.

In addition to this , I used some sort of average statistics to decide if I am the norm or the outlier in a given trend / behavior pattern observed in the industry.

- Not all oppurtunities are equal
- Your Potential Future Pay = ( function(skills you bring) * relevance_factor *         
                                      perceived_value * learning/adaptation_coefficient  expectations_from_life * Non monetary componenets of the Pay ) * risk_profile + Luck

      Luck is a small factor , but not small enough to be ignored.
