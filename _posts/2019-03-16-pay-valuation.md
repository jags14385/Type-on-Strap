I really care about in my __Career Progression__ in addition to a lot of other things is __PAY__ .

It has taken me close to some 8+ years to understand and visualise how much I want to get paid or what exactly I am looking for in terms of pay. 

The interpretation of what __PAY__ means has evolved over time , for me.

Sources such as : 
- [ https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
- [ https://georgestocker.com/2019/03/14/my-salary-progression-in-tech/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
- __Reddit__ & the __Internet__ in general

have helped me navigate this labyrith.

Most of the articles I have read, have been predominantly of US based companies. This helped me understand expectations and also confused me , because the pay structures and offerings in US are differentcompared to other countries such as India & Australia, among others.

Additionally, I used some sort of average statistics to decide if I am the norm or the outlier in a given trend / behavior pattern observed in the industry.

Sources used for these calculations are :
- StackOverFlow Developer Survey
- Salary Distribution (incld perks + work life balance), among peers across different tech companies in the same discipline
- Inputs from Recruiters around what jobs are out there and pay structures + perks for those aforesaid jobs.

Assumptions taken while making these analysis :
- __PAY__ = __MONETARY SUM__ + __PERKS__ + __WORK LIFE BALANCE__ .
- One cannot just have a amazing carrer progression over a period of time , without being paid well. I have seen enough examples of it. You are free to disagree with this.
- You must not be a asshole/sexist/racist or any word which is similar or a synonym.
- Not all oppurtunities are equal.

P.S.: Work life balance has a diverse interpretation and hence canot just be included in as a perk.
