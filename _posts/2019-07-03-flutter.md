title: What I found about Flutter

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) is a UI tool kit to build mobile apps. I have been working with flutter for some time & had presented a brownbag. 
The slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dXzc7VW8yijcGpIM7hN7ozuKasHbJUmajQ4oTkpbAf0?usp=sharing)

Other resources I used were :

- [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io)
- [Flutter Codelabs](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs)

Any thing else comes to your mind, tweet to me . You can find my twitter handle in the footer.

Cheers.
